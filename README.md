## Embedded Programming

In this repo, there are a variety of embedded programming assignments of varying difficulty using MCUs from the PIC32 family, written primarily in C with some supporting python scripts. I am particularly proud of the "Motor Control" project using nested control loops to control a electric motor over various trajectories.
