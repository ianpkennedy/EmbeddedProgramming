## Neopixels

In this demo, a series of WS2812B "neopixels" . In this technique, the neopixels are wired in series to an output of the PIC32 microcontroller. A series of bits is sent to the chain of neopixels, and commands them all simultaneously through bitbanging, where an output pin is turned high or low repeatedly to produce a signal
